    <h2>Movies, TV Series etc.</h2>
    <p>This is a reimagining of my old movies site.<br>
    Most significant is a complete database overhaul.<br>
    It also uses OMDB as it's source for 'golden copy' information.<br>
    Importantly it's been designed so that each film/series has one entry.<br>
    If I own multiple copies then the code is written so that all item information can be seen on one entry.<br>
    It's also designed to understand that TV shows can have multiple seasons and individual episodes.
